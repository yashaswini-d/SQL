TRUNCATE:
  The TRUNCATE TABLE statement is used to remove all records from a table or set of tables in PostgreSQL. 
  It performs the same function as a DELETE statement without a WHERE clause.
  The  TRUNCATE TABLE statement deletes all data from a table without scanning it. This is the reason why it is faster than the DELETE statement.
  The TRUCATE statement won't destroy the structure of Table.
  
Syntax:
  TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
  
Example:
  TRUNCATE TABLE employee;
  
For documentation of TRUCATE refer at https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/sql-truncate.html.
