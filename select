SELECT:
  In postgresql SELECT statement is used to fetch the data from a database table,which returns the data in the form of result table. These result tables are called result sets.
  
Syntax:
  SELECT column1,column2,....columnN FROM table_name;
  
  If we want to fetch all the fields available in the database table we can use the following syntax:
    SELECT * FROM table_name;
    
Example:
  SELECT id,student_name,student_usn FROM student;
                  OR
  SELECT * FROM student
