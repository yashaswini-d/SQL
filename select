SELECT:
  In postgresql SELECT statement is used to fetch the data from a database table,which returns the data in the form of result table. These result tables are called result sets.
  
Syntax:
  SELECT column1,column2,....columnN FROM table_name;
  
  If we want to fetch all the fields available in the database table we can use the following syntax:
    SELECT * FROM table_name;
    
Example:
  SELECT id,student_name,student_usn FROM student;
                  OR
  SELECT * FROM student
  
By using SELECT we can perform several functions:

1.WHERE:
    The WHERE clause uses the condition to filter the rows returned from the SELECT clause.
 
 Syntax:
    SELECT column1,column2,....columnN FROM table_name WHERE CONDITION value;
    CONDITION: =, >, <, >=, <=, !=, AND, OR, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL, NOT.
    
 Example:
    SELECT id,student_name FROM student WHERE student_name IN ('ni','a','ha');
    
 2.GROUP BY:
    The group by clause divides the rows returned from the SELECT statement into groups. For each group you can apply an aggregate function.
    For example sum() to calculete sum of items.
    count() to get the number of items.
    
    Syntax:
      SELECT column1, column2,.... aggregate function(column3), FROM table_name GROUP BY column1,column2,.......
      
    Example:
      SELECT employee_id, sum(salary) FROM employee GROUP BY employee_id;
    
  3.HAVING:
